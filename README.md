# MeKit
Methylation analysis toolkit

For two samples, create a bed file with rows representing CpG Locations, and two columns -- one fore each sample.

Then, run `fisherImplementedIndCpg.pl` to run Fisher's exact test on each CpG. This adds a column for the p-value and the absolute difference in methylation.

Next, run `defineRegions.pl` to select DMRs using a simple sliding window approach.

The paramters for `defineRegions.pl` are:
- `$file` = file generated by `fisherImplementedIndCpg.pl`
- `$diffCutoff` = minimum methylation difference for a CpG to be considered significant, default = 0.5
- `$pvalCutoff` = minimum p-value for a CpG to be considered significant, default = 0.01
- `$minSigCount` = minimum number of significant CpGs in a window for it to be added to the final list of regions, default = 3
- `$windowSize` = size of sliding window, default = 5
- `$resetDistance` = default = 1000

Thus, with the defaults, windows where at least 3/5 CpGs (with gaps of no greater than 1000bp between the CpGs) with a methylation difference of at least 0.5 and p-value < 0.01 will be called significant.
